# fc
A working model of a python flashcard app with crud functionality.  
This README is a guide for absolute beginners regarding how to use this app.

### Requirements
1. Python 3.10 or later
2. Python Compiler
3. Tkinter package
4. pathlib package
5. JSON compatibility

### Running this app
1. Make sure that the JSON included is in the same directory level as the python file
2. Colors and fonts can be changed for more personalization
3. Please do not delete the JSON as it acts like a local database for the flashcards as we have not connected it to any cloud database or more advanced structures.
4. This app has full CRUD functionality and is a very basic minimalist local flashcard app.
5. Install python-tk for macos ```brew install python-tk```
5. Run ```python3 fc.py``` in the terminal at the level containing fc.py
